      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Boil the chana dal in water until soft and cooked through. Drain excess water.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat the jaggery and cardamom powder until the jaggery melts and forms a smooth syrup.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chana dal to the jaggery syrup and mix well. Cook until the mixture thickens and becomes dry. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, turmeric powder, and a pinch of salt. Add water gradually to knead the dough. It should be soft but not sticky. Let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a small disc and place a spoonful of the cooled puran (filling) in the center. Carefully fold the dough around the filling and seal it. Roll it out again to form a flatbread.</li>
        <li>Heat a tawa or griddle and cook the rolled-out puranpoli on both sides, applying oil or ghee as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a dollop of ghee on top!</li>
